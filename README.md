![Back to my Homepage logo](back-to-my-homepage-logo/back-to-my-homepage--scripted-final--with-gradient-applied--cropped.svg)

This is the new and Inkscape-based version of Shlomi Fish’s web graphics
reading “Back to my Homepage” in the style of the logo of the film
[Back to the Future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future) .

Its homepage is now at http://www.shlomifish.org/art/back-to-my-homepage-2nd-ver/ .

The previous version, which was done using CorelDRAW, can be found at
[its page on Shlomi Fish’s site](http://www.shlomifish.org/art/bk2hp/),
but its CDR and resulting GIF may not be too usable.
